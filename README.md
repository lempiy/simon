# Simon

This app is my impelementatin of the popular game of 90ty's - Simon.

- Player should keep in mind a sequence of sound and light signals and recreate it by pushing same buttons as were shown before.
- There is a posability to play a streak mode - every mistake would push you down to the begining of sequence.
- To win you must recover a sequence of 20 sounds.

### You can demo run this app with [gh-pages](http://lempiy.github.io/simon).
